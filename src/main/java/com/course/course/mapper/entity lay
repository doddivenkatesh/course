By default, collections like createdCourses in your User entity are lazy-loaded (@OneToMany defaults to lazy). That means the actual data is fetched only when accessed — but if your service or controller accesses them after the session is closed, Hibernate can't fetch them and throws this error.

How to fix this?
Option 1: Fetch data eagerly (quick but not always recommended)
Change your User entity to:

java
Copy
Edit
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "creator", fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
private List<Course> createdCourses = new ArrayList<>();
But be cautious: eager fetch may lead to performance issues if you have large datasets or multiple collections.

Option 2: Use @Transactional on your service method
Make sure your service method that loads user data is annotated with @Transactional, so the session stays open during mapping:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

@Service
public class UserService {

    @Transactional(readOnly = true)
    public UserDTO findByUserId(Long id) {
        User user = userRepository.findById(id)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("User not found"));

        // Now you can safely access lazy collections here or in mapper
        return UserMapper.toDTO(user);
    }
}
Option 3: Initialize collections manually before session closes
You can force initialization of lazy collections inside your transactional service:

java
Copy
Edit
import org.hibernate.Hibernate;

@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public UserDTO findByUserId(Long id) {
    User user = userRepository.findById(id)
        .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("User not found"));

    Hibernate.initialize(user.getCreatedCourses());
    Hibernate.initialize(user.getEnrolledCourses());

    return UserMapper.toDTO(user);
}
Option 4: Use DTO projection / Fetch joins (best practice)
Modify your repository query to fetch collections eagerly when needed:

java
Copy
Edit
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u LEFT JOIN FETCH u.createdCourses LEFT JOIN FETCH u.enrolledCourses WHERE u.id = :id")
Optional<User> findByIdWithCourses(@Param("id") Long id);
And in your service:

java
Copy
Edit
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public UserDTO findByUserId(Long id) {
    User user = userRepository.findByIdWithCourses(id)
        .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("User not found"));
    return UserMapper.toDTO(user);
}
Summary recommendation for you
Start with Option 2 — add @Transactional on your service methods that fetch users and map entities to DTOs. That keeps the Hibernate session open long enough for lazy collections to be accessed.

If performance or N+1 query issues appear later, consider Option 4 with fetch joins.

Why?
enrolledCourses is @ManyToMany with lazy fetching by default.

When you fetch all users with userRepository.findAll(), their enrolledCourses are not loaded immediately.

When you later map these users to DTOs, the code tries to access enrolledCourses.

But the Hibernate session is closed by then — so lazy loading fails.

How to fix it?
1. Use a fetch join query in your repository to eagerly fetch enrolledCourses when you load users
In your UserRepository:

java
Copy
Edit
@Query("SELECT DISTINCT u FROM User u LEFT JOIN FETCH u.enrolledCourses LEFT JOIN FETCH u.createdCourses")
List<User> findAllWithCourses();
Then in your service, replace:

java
Copy
Edit
List<User> users = userRepository.findAll();
with:

java
Copy
Edit
List<User> users = userRepository.findAllWithCourses();
This way, Hibernate will load users with their enrolledCourses and createdCourses collections eagerly.

2. Make your service method transactional
Add @Transactional(readOnly = true) on the service method that fetches users:

java
Copy
Edit
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public List<UserDTO> findAllUsers() {
    List<User> users = userRepository.findAllWithCourses(); // use fetch join query here
    return users.stream()
                .map(UserMapper::toDTO)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
This guarantees the Hibernate session stays open during mapping.

3. (Optional) Initialize collections manually
If you want to stick with default findAll():

java
Copy
Edit
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public List<UserDTO> findAllUsers() {
    List<User> users = userRepository.findAll();
    users.forEach(user -> {
        Hibernate.initialize(user.getEnrolledCourses());
        Hibernate.initialize(user.getCreatedCourses());
    });
    return users.stream()
                .map(UserMapper::toDTO)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
Summary:
Best practice: Use fetch joins (findAllWithCourses) and mark your service method transactional.

Avoid accessing lazy collections outside transactional boundaries.

Avoid EAGER fetch on collections unless necessary for performance reasons.
