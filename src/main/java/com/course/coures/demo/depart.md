SELECT *
FROM Employee e
WHERE Salary = (
    SELECT MAX(Salary)
    FROM Employee
    WHERE DepartmentId = e.DepartmentId
);


ðŸ”¹ Task 3: SQL Query â€” Employees with Highest Salary per Department
Given table:

Id	Name	Salary	DepartmentId
1	Ram	10000	10
2	Sam	15000	10
3	Ravi	15000	10
4	Tom	20000	20

âœ… Goal:
Return employees who have the maximum salary within each department, including ties.

âœ… SQL Solution (Using Subquery):
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT *
FROM Employee e
WHERE Salary = (
    SELECT MAX(Salary)
    FROM Employee
    WHERE DepartmentId = e.DepartmentId
);
ðŸ§  Explanation:
The correlated subquery:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT MAX(Salary)
FROM Employee
WHERE DepartmentId = e.DepartmentId
gets the maximum salary for each department.

The outer query filters employees whose salary matches the maximum.

ðŸ§ª Output from Query:
Id	Name	Salary	DepartmentId
2	Sam	15000	10
3	Ravi	15000	10
4	Tom	20000	20

âœ… Sam and Ravi both tied with the max salary in Dept 10.

ðŸ”¹ Server-Side Pagination in SQL
To paginate results from the server side, use LIMIT and OFFSET (in MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

âœ… Example Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM Employee
ORDER BY Id
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
LIMIT 10: Return 10 records

OFFSET 20: Skip first 20 records

Useful for page 3 (assuming 10 records per page)

âœ… Why Pagination is Important in Production APIs:
Reason	Explanation
âœ… Performance	Reduces DB load by fetching only what's needed.
âœ… Scalability	Handles large datasets without overloading the client/server.
âœ… User Experience (UX)	Faster page load times, better response times.
âœ… Bandwidth Efficiency	Sends only necessary data over network.
âœ… Avoids Timeouts	Large result sets might crash or timeout without pagination.
